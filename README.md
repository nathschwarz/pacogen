PaCoGen - Passive Code Generator
=======

The pacogen ist meant to do ease the creation of new code-files.
You define shell-variables in your profile and call them later in the template-files. No duplication, no need to update a bunch of templates. Change the variable and that's it - any future created document will have the updated version.

##Why bash?
Because bash is, from the set of languages I am able to use, available on all systems I use. From install on.
